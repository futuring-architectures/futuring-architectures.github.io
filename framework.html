                    <h2>Design Thinking</h2>
                    <p>To design is to value the right question more than the right answer to the wrong question.</p>

                    Ecosystem innovation has all the makings of a wicked problem. 
                    FAST draws from Design Thinking as a collaborative way of coping with such problems.
                    Thinking as a designer implies immersion in a situation, building shared understanding and prototyping solutions. 
                    This combination gives way to the three systems of FAST.

                <h2>INFINITE ITERATION</h2>
                <p>FAST is infinitely iterative. 
                It captures the deliberately repeating behaviours of organisations responding to ecosystem dynamics. 
                From exploring a fuzzy hunch of opportunity, to running a viable platform organisation and back to exploring. 
                Round and round and round</p>
                <p>Revealing the ecosystem frames the platform’s future position. This position challenges the existing organisation to adapt and learn from new, to be revealed versions of the ecosystem.
