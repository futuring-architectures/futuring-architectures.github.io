# Here is FAST

FAST is a hands-on framework for ecosystem innovation and platform organisation. 
It pairs discovery of ecosystem opportunities with  development of complementary platform businesses. 

There is no shortage in publications on platforms and their socio-economic impact. 
These for sure help in understanding why and what: 
in FAST you'll find *how* to frame, design and test platforms.
Step by step and day by day.

## First Steps

Take a few minutes to read up on the [Framework]{:.heading.flip-title} and the challenges it addresses. 
You can also dive into the action right away and pick up on any one of these challenges:
 
* [Reveal]{:.heading.flip-title} --- the ecosystem to design for
* [Position]{:.heading.flip-title} --- your organisation in its ecosystem
* [Organise]{:.heading.flip-title} --- the minimum viable platform experience

## Next Steps

FAST puts ecosystem innovation and platform design in your hands. 
[Download] FAST, set up high-energy design sessions and get platforms embedded in your organisation --- large or small. 
Batteries included; just add a a bit of elbow grease.   

You're most welcome to contribute to the framework.

## That Acronym

**F**uturing **A**rchitectures for **S**ustaining **T**ransitions.

This emphasises the strategic intent and infinitely iterative nature of the framework. 
It also works as a convenient adjective in many situations ðŸ¤­.
