# Here is FAST

FAST is a hands-on framework for ecosystem innovation and platform organisation. 
It pairs discovery of ecosystem opportunities with  development of complementary platform businesses. 

There is no shortage in publications on platforms and their socio-economic impact. 
These for sure help in understanding why and what: 
in FAST you'll find *how* to frame, design and test platforms.
Step by step and day by day.

## Getting "Acquinted"

ðŸ“– Take a few minutes to read up on the [Framework]{:.heading.flip-title}, the components it provides and the process of applying these. 
You can also dive into the action right away and pick up on one of the components directly:
 
* [Reveal]{:.heading.flip-title} --- the ecosystem to design for
* [Position]{:.heading.flip-title} --- your organisation in its ecosystem
* [Organise]{:.heading.flip-title} --- the minimum viable platform experience

## Getting Real

[Download]  FAST and set up a first high-energy, collaborative design session. Each component comes with full instructions, end-to-end examples and a practitioner's manual.
ðŸ”Œ Batteries are included; just add a bit of elbow grease.   

You're most welcome to contribute to the framework. 
The FAST [Trello board] is open to your suggestions, comments and experiences. And join us on [Github] to help fix spelling and grammar errors, or help clarify and extend sections.

## That Acronym

**F**uturing **A**rchitectures for **S**ustaining **T**ransitions.

This emphasises the strategic intent and infinitely iterative nature of the framework. 
It also works as a convenient adjective in many situations ðŸ¤­.
