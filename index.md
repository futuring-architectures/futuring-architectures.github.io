# Here is FAST

FAST is a hands-on framework for ecosystem innovation and platform organisation. 
It pairs discovery of ecosystem opportunities with  development of complementary platform businesses. 

There is no shortage in publications on platforms and their socio-economic impact. 
These for sure help in understanding why and what: 
in FAST you'll find *how* to frame, design and test platforms.
Step by step and day by day.

## That Acronym

**F**uturing **A**rchitectures for **S**ustaining **T**ransitions.

This emphasises the strategic intent and [infinitely iterative](/framework/#infinite-iteration) nature of the framework. 
It also works as a convenient adjective in many situations ðŸ¤­.
