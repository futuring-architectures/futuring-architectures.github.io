The FAST Position tool is build around a structured platform model. This model captures *intended* outcomes and the platform's support for participants *converging* on these. 

The model takes its core structure from the [Tools-Rules-Interaction-Experience](http://platformed.info/the-trie-framework-platforms/) framework: 

![Position Platform Model](../assets/img/pages/fast-platformflow-allgears-tiny.png){:.lead data-width="600" data-height="398"}

The tool expands on this framework with **Frame** and **Challenge**. These capture the output from the [Reveal] tool and the input to the [Organise] tool, respectively. The latter addition also turns the model into a great tool for deciding on what, where and when to build and test next.

[Organise]: organise.md

**Note 1.** It is indeed a (dynamic) model and not a (static) plan: it describes the interplay between outcomes and support structures.

**Note 2.**: The Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics [games framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDA_framework) describes a structure and interplay comparable to TRIE. That's fitting, as both address emergent behaviour.

**Note 3.**: The application of 'design' to ecosystem innovation is somewhat of an oxymoron. The designer cannot know upfront of all challenges that will confront individual participants. The full flow of events in response to any of these challenges is likewise not planned in advance.
