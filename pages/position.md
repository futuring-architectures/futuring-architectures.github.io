The application of 'design' to ecosystem innovation is somewhat of an oxymoron. The designer cannot know upfront of all challenges that will confront individual participants. The full flow of events in response to any of these challenges is likewise not planned in advance.

To this end, the toolkit is build around a platform model. It captures *intended* outcomes and the platform's support for participants *converging* on these. And it is a (dynamic 🚀) model and not a (static 🏔) plan: it describes the interplay between outcomes and support structures.

The model takes its core from the well-established [Tools-Rules-Interaction-Experience](http://platformed.info/the-trie-framework-platforms/) framework. 
The toolkit expands on this framework with **Frame** and **Challenge**. These capture the output from the [Reveal] toolkit and the input to the [Organise] toolkit, respectively. The latter addition also turns the model into a great tool for deciding on what, where and when to build and test next 🗓.
