This release includes enhancements aimed directly at improving the workshop experience for participants and facilitators alike:

* 1️⃣ Introducing the *Enabler* and *Keystone* roles on the new 🎁 Ecosystem Ecology Map to better fit the ecosystem context.
* 2️⃣ Removing references to the roles' position on the Motivation Matrix. These were of no practical use, as it turned out 🤷🏽‍♀️.
* 3️⃣ Introducing the new 🎁 Ecosystem Relationshop Portrait to capture both roles involved in the key ecosystem relationship.
* 4️⃣ Introducing the Transaction and Innovation engines to fit the platform types of the same name from the *Business of Platforms* book [📖](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40604327-the-business-of-platforms).
